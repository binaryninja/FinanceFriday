## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roy-ace.git
cd roy-ace
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Service

```python
from cc_service import CoveredCallService
from strategy_classes import Config

config = Config(symbol="SPY")
service = CoveredCallService(config)
service.start()
```

### 2. Backtesting

```python
from backtest import Backtester
from strategy_classes import Config, StrategyEngine

config = Config(symbol="SPY")
backtest = Backtester(
    strategy_engine=StrategyEngine(...),
    start_date="2023-01-01",
    end_date="2024-01-01"
)
results = backtest.run_backtest()
```

### 3. CLI Interface

```bash
python main.py --symbol SPY --mode live
```

## Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted in `strategy_classes.py`:

```python
@dataclass
class StrategyParameters:
    target_delta: float = 0.3
    min_premium_threshold: float = 0.002
    stop_loss_threshold: float = -0.05
    profit_target: float = 0.02
    position_size: int = 100
    vol_lookback: int = 20
```

## Data Storage

The system uses SQLite for persistence with the following schema:

- `market_data`: Price and volatility history
- `option_chains`: Option quotes and metrics
- `strategy_decisions`: Trade decisions and rationale
- `positions`: Position tracking and P&L

## Risk Management

The system implements multiple layers of risk control:

1. **Market Environment**
   - Volatility regime detection
   - Trend classification
   - Historical volatility thresholds

2. **Position Level**
   - Delta targets
   - Premium thresholds
   - Stop-loss and profit targets

3. **Portfolio Level**
   - Position sizing rules
   - Exposure limits
   - Correlation management

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks:

- Premium yield (monthly/annual)
- Win rate
- Risk-adjusted returns
- Maximum drawdown
- Sharpe/Sortino ratios
