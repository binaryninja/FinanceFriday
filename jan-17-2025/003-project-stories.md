# Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

## **Goal of Phase 1**
- Implement a **basic automated covered call system** for a single underlying ETF (e.g., SPY).
- Focus on monthly expirations, a simple strike selection method (e.g., delta ~ 0.25), and a basic rolling mechanic.
- Enable end-to-end automation with essential data feeds, broker integration, and a rudimentary backtesting module.

### **Epic 1: Data Ingestion & Storage**

**Story 1.1: Ingest SPY Historical Price Data**
- **As a** Strategy Developer
- **I want** to pull historical EOD price data for SPY
- **So that** I can run basic backtesting on the underlying share performance.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Data pipeline retrieves at least 2–5 years of daily historical SPY data (open, high, low, close, volume).
  - Data is stored in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or a flat file if we want simplicity in MVP).
  - Pipeline can be triggered on demand or scheduled (e.g., daily).

**Story 1.2: Ingest SPY Option Chain Data (Historical & Live)**
- **As a** Strategy Developer
- **I want** to retrieve historical and real-time SPY option chain quotes
- **So that** the system can evaluate option premiums and select the appropriate strikes.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Ability to pull at least end-of-day option chain data for the last X years for backtesting.
  - Ability to pull near real-time (or delayed) quotes for live trading (bid, ask, open interest, implied volatility).
  - Data stored in the same database or an in-memory structure for quick access.

**Story 1.3: Basic Data Quality Checks**
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to have simple validation checks on price and option chain data
- **So that** I can ensure there are no missing fields or obviously invalid quotes (e.g., negative prices).

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Automatic logging of missing or incorrect data points.
  - The system either auto-fills from a fallback source or flags for manual intervention.

### **Epic 2: Strategy Engine (MVP Version)**

**Story 2.1: Simple Strike Selection (Delta-Based)**
- **As a** Covered Call Trader
- **I want** an algorithm that picks a strike with delta ~0.25 for monthly expirations
- **So that** I have a consistent, straightforward approach to collecting premium.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The system retrieves the relevant option chain for the next monthly expiration (around 30 days to expiry).
  - The system identifies the call option whose delta is closest to 0.25.
  - The system logs which strike is chosen and the premium at selection time.

**Story 2.2: Position Sizing**
- **As a** Covered Call Trader
- **I want** the system to ensure I only sell calls for the shares I own
- **So that** I never exceed my actual covered share count.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - For every 100 shares of SPY in the account, the system can sell 1 call contract.
  - If I own 200 shares, it can sell 2 calls, etc.
  - If I don’t have enough shares, the system does not initiate a short call trade.

**Story 2.3: Simple Rolling Logic**
- **As a** Covered Call Trader
- **I want** the system to roll the call if it becomes ITM in the final week before expiration
- **So that** I can reduce the chance of assignment (or handle assignment proactively).

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - If the underlying price is within X% of the strike (or ITM) and fewer than 7 days remain, the system triggers a roll-out to the next monthly cycle at the same or higher strike.
  - The system logs the roll transaction (buy back current call, sell next month’s call).

**Story 2.4: Basic Logging & Order Tracking**
- **As a** Trader
- **I want** a record of all trades the system places
- **So that** I can track P&L and diagnose any issues.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - All trade executions (sell calls, roll, etc.) are timestamped and stored (database or CSV).
  - Basic P&L fields (premium received, net credit/debit after closing/rolling).

---

### **Epic 3: Broker Integration**

**Story 3.1: Connect to a Broker API (e.g., Interactive Brokers)**
- **As a** Trader
- **I want** to place trades automatically through the broker API
- **So that** I don’t have to manually enter orders.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System can authenticate with the chosen broker’s API.
  - Able to place a test trade (paper trading environment is acceptable).
  - Able to retrieve account positions (to confirm the number of SPY shares held).

**Story 3.2: Automated Order Execution**
- **As a** Strategy Engine
- **I want** to place limit orders at the mid-price
- **So that** I aim for better fills and reduce slippage.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - For each selected option, the system sends a limit order around the mid of bid/ask.
  - If not filled within a certain time window or threshold, the system can adjust the order slightly.
  - Confirmation of fill status is retrieved and logged.

**Story 3.3: Error Handling & Notifications**
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to be alerted if an order fails, is partially filled, or times out
- **So that** I can intervene if necessary.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System sends an alert (email or Slack) if an order is rejected or remains unfilled for too long.
  - Failed orders are automatically logged for troubleshooting.

### **Epic 4: Basic Backtesting**

**Story 4.1: Historical Covered Call Simulation**
- **As a** Strategy Researcher
- **I want** to run a simple backtest over the last 2+ years
- **So that** I can measure the strategy’s performance vs. buy-and-hold.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Backtest includes monthly covered call selling with delta ~0.25.
  - Strategy “owns” 100 shares of SPY per contract.
  - Logs P&L (premiums collected minus any losses on the calls plus underlying gains/losses).

**Story 4.2: Performance Metrics**
- **As a** Strategy Researcher
- **I want** to see returns, drawdowns, and basic stats
- **So that** I can compare covered call performance to a benchmark.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - At minimum: Overall P&L, annualized return, maximum drawdown.
  - Comparison to SPY buy-and-hold returns in the same timeframe.

### **Epic 5: Basic Reporting & Alerts**

**Story 5.1: Trade Summary Dashboard**
- **As a** User
- **I want** a simple UI (could be a local Jupyter notebook or Streamlit app)
- **So that** I can see open positions, realized premium, and next action dates.

  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Dashboard lists current short calls, expiration dates, strikes, and P&L.
  - Historical trade list with a summary of total premiums collected.

**Story 5.2: End-of-Day/Week Notifications**
- **As a** Trader
- **I want** automated updates about the strategy’s status
- **So that** I’m always informed of upcoming expirations or rolls.

- **So that** I can diversify premium income sources.

**Story 8.2: Per-Asset Parameters**
- **As a** Developer
- **I want** to define custom strike deltas, expirations, or rolling logic for each ETF
- **So that** I can fine-tune each asset individually.

---

### **Epic 9: Enhanced Backtesting & Walk-Forward Analysis**

**Story 9.1: Walk-Forward Analysis**
- **As a** Quant Researcher
- **I want** to split historical data into train/test windows

## Final Notes

- **Start Small**: Phase 1 ensures a functional system that can trade monthly calls on SPY, roll near expiration, and log basic performance.
- **Iterate & Validate**: Move to Phase 2 only after MVP is proven reliable (ideally in paper trading, then small real-money trades).
- **Scalability & Maintenance**: As the codebase grows with new features (Phase 2 and 3), ensure robust testing, code reviews, and documentation to keep the system stable over time.
